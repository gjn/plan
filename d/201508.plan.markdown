## 3D

* Responded to gal's great analysis and overall improvements. Guy can code.

## Jenkins

* Created spreadsheet to keep track of jenkins failures and their reasons a little
  more systematci than by emails.
* Did run jenkins every hour during the night. We still have troubles with the
  tooling we are using. Browserstack is not stable. Some of our tests are not
  stable enough to be of value. This needs to be adressed. I hope I can move
  people.

## 3D

* Great kick-off meeting for 3D viewer inside map.geo.admin.ch. We have a good
  team that will get it done. Still alot of open questions regarding data and
  draping layers, etc. We will fully integrate it into our dev cycle (meaning, 3d
  code will end up in master very soon) and make it activatable via switch.
* We need to create most common layers as transformed tiles. Otherwise, mapproxy
  is going to explode during development.
* Some discussion about the strange artefacts with c2c people. Looks like gal is
  on track to find something. When a viewer is your only debugging tool, you will
  be slow. We should try to speed up this process altogether.

## Deploy

* Had to re-deploy bod to integration
* Had to re-deploy bod to int/prod as well as ga3 snapshot to int/prod (bod was
  configured wrongly)
* Deploy process is botched because of caching issue. To really be sure, we need
  to deploy ga3 twice in the future.

## Jenkins

* Replied to Matthiue about troubles we still have with new Jenkins instance.
* Lots of stuff needed to be done to get Jenkins finally rolling. Among others a
  really strange bug in ga3 unit tests that were just visible on the jenkins
  instance.

## MAP

* Georanking and Data ranking. How can we satisfy our clients and still create a
  reasonable user experience. How can we guide the user to new and exciting
  information with discriminating _some_ clients. Is it even possible?
* Some minor reviews.

## 3D

* Use tlm layer as default layer on application start of test application. TLM
  will be the default layer in final application, so it kine of makes sense.
* Flushing varnish takes some time...

## Tools

* Jenkins migration. Not as easy. We should start managing this stuff with puppet.
  It's a pain with the rights and software packages installed/needed.

## Admin

* All those mails.
